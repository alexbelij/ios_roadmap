# ROADMAP FOR LEARNING iOS
I had learned and worked as iOS developer for a half year since I was in the university. It was from Feb to Aug 2008. At that time, I did not have any experience about Android, and also about programming in general. Now I'm quite familiar with Android. I know that it is still not enough for me to become a "senior" Android developer, but I really like to try new language. As a quoted I read on the internet: "Try 1 new programming language each year". So today I will try to learn iOS again, in the better way than I did in the past.

Because iOS is also mobile programming, so it should be quite similiar to Android. I will learn by mapping Android components, issues to iOS. But iOS and Android have really different framework, this is exactly I need to understand about them.

After reading each section, I will update some notes to compare with Android, also its keypoint I think.

## 1. Understanding Objective-C
I thought that, at the begining I need to read all the details given from [developer site] (https://developer.apple.com).

It is enough for **code path** I think, let's move to another extra/advanced topic, what is gson, evenbus, retrofit... in iOS, how about rx?

## 3. Extra topics (TBD)
Firstly let take a look at **developer site**

3.1 [iOS App Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html)

3.2 [View Programming Guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/WindowsViews/Conceptual/ViewPG_iPhoneOS/Introduction/Introduction.html)

Dont skip the tutorial from this site: 

3.3 [raywenderlich iOS](https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/ios)

3.4 [tutorialspoint iOS](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/ios/ios_getting_started.htm)

## 4. Buiding an App.
In this topic, I will try to build my own iOS app, then better try to publish it also. This is conclusion of what I've learned in previous topics and I must know how to publish an ios app into apple store. I heard that it is quite complicated than Android.

## 5. Let SWIFT
My friend, who is much experienced iOS developer, suggested me to follow this one 
- [raywenderlich swift](https://www.raywenderlich.com/category/swift)
- Current I'm really interested in online programming course, so I tried to get familiar with `Swift 3` with this [`Udemy course`](https://www.udemy.com/devslopes-ios10). It takes around 29$ on discount.
