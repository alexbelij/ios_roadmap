# ROADMAP FOR LEARNING IOS
I had learned and worked as IOS developer for a half year since I was in university. It was from Feb to Aug 2008. At that time, I did not have any experience about Android, and also about programming in general. Now I'm quite familiar with Android. I know that it is still not enough for me to become an "senior" Android developer, but I really like to try new language. As a quoted I read on the internet: "Trying 1 new programming language each year". So today I will try to learn IOS again, in the better way than in the past.

Because IOS is also mobile programming, so it should be quite similiar to Android. I will learn by mapping Android components, issues to IOS. But IOS and Android have really different framework, this is exactly I need to understand about them.
